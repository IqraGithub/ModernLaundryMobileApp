================= cartSlice.js =================
cartSlice.js is a Redux slice that manages the state of the app. It uses the createSlice function from the Redux Toolkit library to create a slice of the Redux store for managing the cart state. The initial state of the cart is an object with a single property products, which is an empty array.


================= Reducer functions =================
The slice includes several reducer functions for updating the cart state:

1) addToCart: adds a new product to the cart.

2) removeFromCart: removes a product from the cart by its id.

3) updateCartItemQuantity: updates the quantity of a product in the cart by its id.

4) updateItemServiceType: updates the service type and price of a product in the cart by its id.

5) updateItemDelivery: updates the delivery type of a product in the cart by its id.

6) updateDeliveryType: updates the delivery type and service price of a product in the cart by its id.


================= Selectors =================

The slice also exports several selectors for accessing data from the cart state:

1) selectCart: selects the entire cart state.

2) selectAllCartItems: selects all products in the cart.

3) selectCartItemById: selects a specific product in the cart by its id.

4) selectCartTotalPrice: calculates and selects the total price of all products in the cart.

5) selectCartTotalQuantity: calculates and selects the total quantity of all products in the cart.

6) selectItemTotalPrice: calculates and selects the total price of a specific product in the cart by its id.


================= Usage =================
To use this slice, you can import it into your Redux store. You can then dispatch actions to update the cart state and use selectors to access data from it.
